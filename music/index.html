          Over quarantine, I found myself needing a large project to commit
          myself to help fill up the seemingly endless downtime. As a result, I
          took up the hobby of arranging various jazz standards for piano and
          then teaching myself  them. When I was arranging these pieces, I tried
          to capture the various  moods given by the pieces and stay faithful to
          creating the themes and atmospheres of these pieces. In the following
          list, I'm planning on detailing the research I did for these pieces.
          Hope you enjoy!
