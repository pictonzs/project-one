        <p>
          Over quarantine, I found myself needing a large project to commit
          myself to help fill up the seemingly endless downtime. As a result, I
          took up the hobby of arranging various jazz standards for piano and
          then teaching myself  them. When I was arranging these pieces, I tried
          to capture the various  moods given by the pieces and stay faithful to
          creating the themes and atmospheres of these pieces. In the following
          list, I'm planning on detailing the research I did for these pieces.
          Hope you enjoy!

                Originally the theme song written by Sammy Fain for the Disney
                movie in 1951
              </li>
              <li class="covers">
                The song has since been covered by several jazz artists including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Oscar Peterson</li>
                  <li>Bill Evans</li>
                  <li>Dave Brubeck</li>

                Personally I studied Bill Evans version from the 1961 album
                Sunday at the Village Vanguard, which in my opinion showcases
                the pristine harmony from the songs very basic reliance on 2-5-1
                chord progresssions

          <li>I Hear a Rhapsody
            <ul>
              <li class="origin">Orginally a pop song written in 1941</li>
              <li class="covers">It has been covered by several jazz icons, such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>Frank Sinatra</li>
                  <li>John Coltrane</li>
                  <li>Bill Evans and Jim Hall</li>

                I personally arranged this piece keeping in mind that every
                voice being played, both the melody and harmony lines, should
                have a constant melodic movement as the song is centered
                around hearing music
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>La Vie En Rose

                Orginally an incredibly popular french pop song released in
                1945
              </li>
              <li class="covers">It was the signature song of French singer Ã‰dith Piaf</li>
              <li class="covers">
                Has since been covered by many remarkable artists,
                including:
                <ul>
                  <li>Bing Crosby</li>
                  <li>Dean Martin</li>
                  <li>Louis Armstrong</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li class="interpret">
                I studied the Louis Armstrong version and attempted to capture
                a feeling of constantly falling to compliment the lilting
                melody and thematic ideas of falling into love
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
